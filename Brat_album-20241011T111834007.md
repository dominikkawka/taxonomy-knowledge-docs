# Brat
Brat is the sixth studio album by English singer Charli XCX, released through Atlantic Records on 7 June 2024. It features production by Charli XCX, her longtime executive producer A. G. Cook, Finn Keane, Cirkut, her partner George Daniel, and others. The album draws influence from the 2000s English rave music scene, with a more aggressive club sound than her previous album, Crash (2022). A deluxe edition with three additional tracks was released on 10 June 2024. Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat, a remix album of 16 selected tracks on Brat featuring 20 artists was released on 11 October 2024.

Brat was met with widespread acclaim from critics. Commercially, it debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and reached the top 10 in 12 additional countries, including the United States, where it debuted at number three, Charli XCX's highest debut. According to Metacritic, it is the highest rated album of 2024 and the 16th-highest-rated album of all time as of October 2024. The album was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize for 2024 album of the year.

The cover art and aesthetic became a popular Internet trend, and was adopted by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign after Charli XCX tweeted about the candidate.

## Background and release
Brat is Charli XCX's sixth studio album and first after renewing her contract with Atlantic Records in early 2023. It was announced on 28 February 2024, a day before the release of the lead single "Von Dutch".

According to Charli XCX, Brat is her "most aggressive and confrontational record", but also her most vulnerable. On 22 February, during her Boiler Room warehouse set, she debuted snippets of tracks identified as "Spring Breakers" and "365". She was joined onstage by Addison Rae and Julia Fox; a "Von Dutch" remix with Rae and A. G. Cook was released on 22 March. On 6 March, she premiered "So I" at the Billboard Women in Music event. "Club Classics" and "B2B" were released on 3 April as a two-pack promotional single.

After teasing the song for a few days, on 29 April, Charli announced the release of the next single, "360". It was released on 10 May alongside its music video, which was teased earlier that day, and was described by her as her "best music video ever". The video features multiple "it girls", including Gabbriette, Chloë Sevigny, Julia Fox, and Rachel Sennott. A remix of "360" soon followed, featuring Swedish artists Robyn and Yung Lean, which was released on 31 May. During her 1 June headlining set at Barcelona's Primavera Sound festival, she debuted two unreleased songs live, "365" and "Everything Is Romantic".

Brat was released on 7 June 2024. A deluxe edition, titled Brat and It's the Same but There's Three More Songs So It's Not, was released on 10 June, containing three additional songs. On 21 June, a remix version of "Girl, So Confusing" featuring New Zealand singer Lorde was released. On 1 August 2024, a remix version of "Guess" from the deluxe edition was released featuring singer Billie Eilish. The following day, "Apple" was released to Italian radio as the album's third single. On 12 September, a "Talk Talk" remix featuring Troye Sivan was released along with the announcement of a remix album titled Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat scheduled for 11 October 2024.

## Composition
Brat channels the illegal London rave scene, where Charli XCX started performing as a teenager. She also mentioned that Brat "is probably the closest album to [her 2017 mixtape] Pop 2 in its ethos". It has been described as consisting of electropop, club-pop, hyperpop, electroclash, and dance styles. Charli XCX told Billboard's Katie Bain that Brat is produced from a tight collection of sounds to create "this unique minimalism that is very loud and bold". The Face's Shaad D'Souza compared the album's sound to 2000s-era Ministry of Sound compilations The Annual and Rihanna's 2010 album Loud, calling the lyrics "shady and bratty, but tender and heartbreaking".

Charli XCX has confirmed that track "Girl, So Confusing" explores her contentious relationship with a fellow female artist. Listeners speculated that the track was about Marina Diamandis, Rina Sawayama, or Lorde, whom the track was later confirmed to be about. Lorde then appeared on the song's remix version. "Sympathy Is a Knife" alludes to another similar situation; the song has been speculated to be about her relationship with Taylor Swift, as well as Charli's perception of her relationship with the 1975's lead singer Matty Healy.

"Rewind" was written as a direct response to the success of "Speed Drive" from Barbie the Album. "Mean Girls", a song partially inspired by Red Scare co-host Dasha Nekrasova and actress and model Julia Fox, focuses on society's "fascination with mean girls". The Face called the track "So I" "a knotty exploration of her grief about [the death of] Sophie". "Apple" was written with inspiration from the writing style of Charli XCX's close friend and collaborator Caroline Polachek. "I Think About It All The Time" sees Charli XCX contemplating motherhood after meeting her friend and collaborator Noonie Bao's baby. In an interview before Brat's release, she said: "am I less of a woman if I don't have a kid? Will I feel like I've missed out on my purpose in life? I know we're not supposed to say that, but it's this biological and social programming."

Brat's deluxe version adds three new songs. "Hello Goodbye" was described as "crush-addled". On "Guess", Charli XCX challenges a subject to guess the color of her underwear, which critics called "unapologetically flirty and suggestive". "Spring Breakers" suggests that Charli XCX's edginess bars her from music industry events such as the Grammy Awards.

## Artwork and marketing
Anticipating the release of Brat, the cover art of Charli XCX's discography was updated across streaming platforms to match its appearance.

Brat's artwork and packaging was designed by New York City-based studio Special Offer, Inc. The cover is a lime green square with the title in lowercase imposed in Arial font. In a cover story interview for Vogue Singapore, Charli told Chandreyee Ray that criticism led her to question why fans feel "ownership over female artists" so much so that they demand their photograph be on all their work; she had previously called it "misogynistic and boring" on X. Of the album cover's colour—which is specifically Pantone 3507C—she said that green was heavily oversaturated in the media and fashion: "I wanted to go with an offensive, off-trend shade of green to trigger the idea of something being wrong. I'd like for us to question our expectations of pop culture—why are some things considered good and acceptable, and some things deemed bad? I'm interested in the narratives behind that and I want to provoke people. I'm not doing things to be nice".

Despite its simple appearance, the album cover's design underwent a five-month development process, maintaining a green square with text. Freaney selected the colour after examining around 500 shades, aiming for an off-putting, garish effect. The final shade resonated with Charli's vision of bold irreverence. The typography, based on Arial, was chosen for its non-"precious" feel. While considering various Swiss typefaces, Freaney wanted to surpass Helvetica. The text, slightly stretched to "give it a personality", is awkwardly placed to be neither small and tasteful nor large and loud, creating an opinion-less aesthetic.

In the weeks leading up to Brat's release, a wall in Greenpoint, Brooklyn—which fans called the "brat wall"—was painted and repainted with the album's signature green color and various messages. Over the summer, its messages changed frequently in line with the album's promotion cycle. The first message was "i'm your fav reference"—a lyric from the single "360"—before it was repainted to simply "brat". On June 10, when Brat's deluxe edition was released, the wall was changed to white with the message "brat and it's the same but there's three more songs so it's not". By the middle of June, the wall remained white but changed its message to "lorde", indicating Lorde's possible involvement with future releases pertaining to Brat, which soon appeared in the remix version of "Girl, So Confusing". The final message of the Brat wall—"ok bye!" in the album's signature green—was painted on July 1.

## Impact
People's Sadie Bell linked the album cover with the nature of the album, which Charli XCX called "confrontational". Dubbed the "Brat summer" trend, the style of album cover and the specific shade of green became a viral sensation after a "Brat generator" tool surfaced online that allowed users to replicate the cover with their own custom text. The London Eye landmark was lit up in lime green on the day of the album's release. National Geographic acknowledged the album and the "brat girl" persona in a Brat-themed article discussing rebellious female icons throughout history, including Cleopatra, Wu Zetian, Lucrezia Borgia, Georgiana Cavendish, and Aurore Dupin (aka George Sand).

### In political campaigning
As part of their 2024 United Kingdom general election campaign, the Green Party of England and Wales posted a replica of the album cover to social media that read "vote green" instead of "brat". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan received a mixed response when replicating the cover on his Instagram to promote the success of the Ultra Low Emission Zone scheme.

After Joe Biden decided to withdraw from the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the official Biden-Harris campaign profile renamed itself "Kamala HQ" and changed its banner picture in imitation of the album cover, replacing "brat" with "kamala hq". This occurred after Charli XCX tweeted about Harris on X (formerly Twitter), saying "kamala IS brat". Charli XCX later stated that although not meant as an explicit endorsement, she was "happy to help prevent democracy from failing forever". Multiple TikTok videos have shown edits of songs from the album with footage of Harris in the background. Some analysts have suggested the connection between the campaign and album will create enthusiasm among young voters.

According to the review aggregator Metacritic, Brat received "universal acclaim" based on a weighted average score of 95 out of 100 from 24 critic scores. The website's report reads, "Critics have embraced the album's rave-influenced sound that eliminates some of the accessibility (and guest stars) of prior album Crash in favor of a rawer, grittier, and more sophisticated sound that is no less fun. Club classic, indeed." As of October 2024, it ranks as the highest-rated album of 2024 and the 16th-highest-rated album of all time on the website. The review aggregator site AnyDecentMusic? compiled 28 reviews and gave the album an average of 8.7 out of 10. Critics praised Charli XCX's emotional vulnerability and several declared Brat to be one of her best albums, with Laura Snapes of The Guardian calling it a masterpiece.

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described the album as "bratty and brash" but "frequently vulnerable". Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone wrote that Brat was a "hyperpop rollercoaster of post-Saturn return, early-thirties anxieties, and It-girl bravado". Ben Tipple from DIY saw the album as a manifestation of the singer's rave roots, dubbing it "an unmistakable representation of her very core; an exhilarating ode to the multiple facets of club culture".

Meaghan Garvey of Pitchfork lauded the album as "substantial in new ways for Charli" and gave it the distinction of Best New Music. Pitchfork also recognized "Von Dutch" and the "Girl, So Confusing" remix with Lorde as Best New Tracks upon their respective releases. Writing for Paste, Eric Bennett praised the album and described it as "messy and vulnerable... in a way Charli's work has lacked over the last decade".

Critic and YouTuber Anthony Fantano of The Needle Drop gave Brat a rare score of 10/10 after release.

## Commercial performance
In the United Kingdom, Brat debuted at number two (selling 27,234 units) on the UK Albums Chart, earning Charli her second top ten charting album and her biggest opening week sales in the country. This sparked controversy among media outlets who accused Taylor Swift of hogging the number one spot in the UK by releasing a new version of her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, available only in the UK, the same week that Brat was released. As of 25 July 2024, Brat sold 71,738 copies in the country.

In the US, Brat debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 with 77,000 album-equivalent units sold on its opening week, consisting of 40,000 pure album sales. With this feat, it became Charli's highest-charting album in the country. It also earned Charli her highest first week overall sales and her biggest streaming week ever with 46.72 million streams. As of 21 August 2024, it sold 500,000 copies in the country.
